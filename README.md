## Task

1. Find refuelings with 5% accuracy
2. Find cases seem like fuel stealing
3. Determine mode with the largest fuel consumption
4. Determine modes with cargo transportation
5. Determine style of driving
6. Classify vehicles

## Dataset

Dataset description:

* Five vehicles
* For each vehicle five files
	1. `vehicleID_fuelLevel.csv` - fuel level with measuring time
	2. `vehicleID_ingection.csv` - ignition mask with measuring time
	3. `vehicleID_refueling2.csv` - test set for 1, 2
	4. `vechicleID_speedAndHeight.csv` - measuring time, velocity (km/h), height (meters)
	5. `vehicleID_tachometer.csv` - revs count per minute with measuring time
	
## Solution

All implemented solutions are represented in the `notebooks` folder as Python notebooks.
